# Medicompare


We've built a web app that helps patients to compare the costs of medical procedures at hospitals in their region. By making hidden healthcare costs more transparent, we're empowering citizens to take a stand on their health and wallet.

# Setup

Just run:

```
npm install
npm install -g nodemon
```

# Running

Ensure you have [Nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) installed, then run:
